# 👋 Hi there, I’m Yifei Ma

Welcome to my workspace – where code meets curiosity, and creativity drives everything I build.

## 🧭 Who I Am

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University (Vancouver). But before that, I was a teacher.

In 2022, I made a bold transition into tech, inspired by the rise of AI and the realization that understanding code would be essential for shaping the future. I started from scratch—learning arrays, sets, and linked lists. It was slow, sometimes frustrating, but deeply fulfilling.

Since then, my journey has taken me through:

- A full-time web development bootcamp at BrainStation (later became a TA)
- Several Game Jams, both collaborative and solo (the first solo one… failed epically—but taught me a lot)
- Building a modular 2D game engine in C++ with ECS and custom event systems
- Exploring how AI and game development intersect—whether it’s LLM-driven characters or real-time in-game assistance

## 🎮 What I’m Exploring

- 🛠 Building a **2D Game Engine** in C++ using SDL3
- 🧠 Designing **OnCallGuide.ai**, a voice-driven support system using RAG + LLMs
- 🧪 Prototyping gameplay systems like movement, input, and basic AI
- 📚 Deepening my knowledge in C++, system design, and creative game mechanics

I’m especially interested in the creative space between **tools and experience**—how we can build systems that don’t just work, but feel meaningful to use or play.
