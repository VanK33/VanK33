### 🙋🏻‍♂️ About Me ###

Hi there 👋 I'm Yifei Ma
I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Prior to this, I transitioned into tech through BrainStation, where I honed my skills in software development and data analysis. My interests span across game development, software engineering, and creative problem-solving through technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning Unity and expanding my knowledge in game development.
🎮 In my free time, I enjoy gaming and snowboarding.
💡 I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.
🔭 I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects or game development.

### 🏗️ Plans and Horizon ###

At the moment, my primary focus is on my graduate studies in Computer Science at Northeastern University. However, I am also dedicating time to learning Unity to develop early models of game ideas. This will allow me to apply my coding skills in a creative, practical way while continuing to grow my expertise in game development.
