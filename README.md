# Hi there üëã I'm Yifei, welcome to my Workspace #

## **Junior Full Stack Developer - Vancouver, BC** ##

### üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me ###

With expertise in React, Node.js, MySQL, JavaScript, Typescript, and Excel VBA, I bring a diverse skill set to my role as a Teaching Assistant at BrainStation. This position allows me to fully immerse myself in the field, providing numerous opportunities to refine my code review skills and mentor aspiring developers. I am genuinely interested in leveraging my toolkit for real-world applications, using my methodical problem-solving abilities to make a tangible impact. My pursuit of practical experience reflects my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth, as I strive to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.

### üèóÔ∏è Plans and Horizon ###

I am developing [TradingBot](https://github.com/VanK33/trading-bot) as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of class-based software development protocols with Typescript and to practice unit and integration testing using Jest. The goal of this project is to design an autonomous trading bot that utilizes the [InteractiveBrokers Typescript API](https://github.com/stoqey/ib) ported by Stoqey. Currently, the project includes only a limited set of strategies, reflecting my existing knowledge. Significant enhancements will be necessary before the bot is ready for serious investors.
